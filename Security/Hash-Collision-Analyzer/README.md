# üîÅ Hash Collision Simulator

## Description

**Hash Collision Simulator** is a C program that demonstrates how many attempts it takes to find weak and strong collisions using truncated SHA-256 hashes (first 3 bytes).  
It simulates two types of collisions:
- **Weak collision**: Find a message that collides with a fixed target.
- **Strong collision**: Find any two distinct messages that collide.
